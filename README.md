# Workshop-Auth-F3
Setting up authentication with jsonwebtoken, hashing passwords with bcrypt and adding authorization middleware.
Creation of REST APIs and linking the authentication to the front-end built using react and redux for state management.
Redux thunk was used for creating asynchronous action creators.
I used Mongo Altas to connect the db and ignored the .env containing my MONGO_URI and the secretOrKey used to encode the jwt.
I installed concurrently to run the front and the back commands simultaniously.
Check the package.json for running the scripts.
